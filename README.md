Velyaer is a turn based strategy game written in TI-BASIC for the TI-84 calculator as a side project for fun.

It features: 
* Procedurally generated maps

## Playing the game

As of the moment, only a few features are available.
At any point, **press the ON button to quit the game.**
Press enter until you get to character selection, then choose a character.

You should then see a world map, which will allow you to select which region you would like to travel to. Certain paths will close off others!
After selecting a region, you will enter combat. 

Click on adjacent squares to move, or click on your own character to swap combat modes.

Click on an adjacent enemy during attack mode to attack them!
Enemies cannot attack diagonally adjacent.

Once all enemies are dead, you should see the world map again to select the next region to travel to.
